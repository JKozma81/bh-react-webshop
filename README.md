# BH React Webshop Project

## Description

This was our last project in the bootcamp. It is a basic implementation of a standard webshop without the payment feature.
We started to develop the projects server and admin UI in 4 teams with one fix member and 1 rotating after each new feature was developed, but due to absence, just 3 teams finished it. I left my team to help others. After we got the public UI development as a homework, I went back to my teamâ€™s half-developed server and admin UI code and rewrote it all using the newly learned redux.
This is still a basic CRUD app with self-developed carousels since we were not allowed to use any external packages or the bootstrap carousel.
